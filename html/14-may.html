<h2><strong>SPRING-ING INTO SOLIDARITY BY SUPPORTING COMMUNITY FRIDGES</strong></h2>
<p>As I’ve been seeking more intentional involvement with mutual aid efforts in LA in recent months and learning to practice the value of solidarity, I’ve learned a lot about the broad network of community fridges here. I’ve been so inspired by the neighbors who stock, clean, maintain, and find nourishment in them. I’ve also been surprised at how such a simple concept can create an accessible and impactful point of care for a neighborhood.” Community fridges are neighborhood spaces that house food and keep it fresh so that anyone can take what they need. “Take what you need, leave what you don’t” is a common refrain you might see or hear in the world of community fridges.</p>
<p>Wanting to pace myself with new commitments, I’d never even visited a community fridge in LA until last week. But it’s never too late to find new ways to care for your neighbors, and I’ve found that my local community fridge is one of the simplest and most accessible ways to do so. If you’ve been thinking of making a community fridge part of your routine, I’m right here with you – figuring it out as I go.  </p>
<p>One tip that comes from the wonderful resource that is the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/lacommunityfridges/?utm_source=MutualAidLA&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=14-may" target="_blank">LA Community Fridges Network</a> (see below!) is to gather ingredients that go together to form a complete meal. This gives me more of a game plan when I’m at the grocery store. Here are some ideas I’m going to try in the coming weeks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tofu + bell pepper + packaged broccoli florets + rice + bottled stir-fry sauce</li>
<li>Pasta + jarred marinara + brick of parmesan or bag of vegan shreds</li>
<li>Tortillas + canned beans + bell pepper + bag of shredded cheese + enchilada sauce</li>
<li>Packaged flatbread + canned chickpeas + curry cooking sauce + packaged snap peas + plain yogurt cup</li>
<li>Cucumber + tomato + lemon + feta cheese + packaged pita bread + hummus</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="" class="newsletter-image" src="https://buttondown.imgix.net/images/62846d8f-3928-4b1d-9c7f-56de106621b1.jpg?w=960&amp;fit=max" />  </p>
<p>I’m learning that cooked or par-cooked versions of ingredients, such as boil-in-bag rice and canned beans, are really helpful!</p>
<p>It’s important to remember that keeping an eye out for safe and yummy foods that would otherwise go to a landfill is another way to keep your community fridge stocked. If you attended a catered function and there are leftovers, you can portion them individually for grab-and-go access. If you have fruit trees or a vegetable garden, you can share extra produce with your neighbors. Even ice packs, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CYHVcebrr80/?utm_source=MutualAidLA&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=14-may" target="_blank">utensils and grocery bags</a> you might otherwise toss can help someone get their food selections home more easily. Buying extra groceries can be part of your routine; <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CeCzxV2LKIv/?utm_source=MutualAidLA&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=14-may" target="_blank">so can building the habit of reducing waste</a> whenever you can.</p>
<p>Last week, I found my nearest fridge on Instagram and added it as a stop on my route home from work. I had tofu, vegetables, and stir-fry sauce in the backseat. It was fast and easy, and it felt good to be part of my neighborhood’s network of care in such a material way. In the future, I might also keep some cleaning supplies and trash bags in my car in case I notice it needs some TLC. Most importantly, I’m trying to remember that the best way to keep my community fridge running is to simply visit it consistently.</p>
<p>If you’re ready to jump in with me in supporting your community fridge this spring, you can visit <a href="https://linktr.ee/lacommunityfridge?utm_source=MutualAidLA&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=14-may" target="_blank">linktr.ee/lacommunityfridge</a> to see a map of active fridges in LA.

See you at the fridge!</p>

<h2>FEATURED EFFORT: <strong>POWER BLOSSOMS</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.powerblossoms.org/?utm_source=MutualAidLA&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=14-may" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="newsletter-image" src="https://buttondown.imgix.net/images/3f3335d9-6129-4795-a009-bced6e7b415d.jpg?w=960&amp;fit=max" /></a>  </p>
<p>Presumably, Dispatch readers know that the carceral system in the United States is inhumane, corrupt, and destructive. (In other words, it’s functioning as it was designed to.) But the Los Angeles County jail system is particularly fucked up.</p>
<p>For the uninitiated, here are a few not-so-fun facts to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>On the day I am writing this, 13,739* incarcerated people sit in LA County jails, almost half of whom are pre-trial or, put another way, legally innocent. The County detains many of these folks simply because they can’t afford cash bail.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>LA County holds the appalling “honor” of having the largest jail system in the country. Over the last decade, the county jails have held between 14,000 and 19,000 incarcerated people, on average, on any given day.  For perspective, the second largest jail system—New York City’s, home to Rikers Island,—incarcerated, over the same period, an average of between 7,000 and 13,000 people.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Last year, the <a href="https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/court-rules-la-county-must-fix-overcrowding-and-abysmal-conditions-jails-booking?utm_source=MutualAidLA&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=14-may" target="_blank">ACLU</a> described the condition of some LA county jails as “barbaric” and the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-03-28/three-inmates-died-in-the-los-angeles-county-jails-in-just-over-a-week?utm_source=MutualAidLA&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=14-may" target="_blank">LA Times noted</a> this year that at the Inmate Reception Center, “people are routinely chained to chairs or gurneys; denied food, water and showers; and made to sleep in cells covered with feces.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And, in a nine-day-period in March of this year, three people in LA’s jails died in custody. None of the three had been convicted of a crime. (Not that that should matter.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="" class="newsletter-image" src="https://buttondown.imgix.net/images/b4f2be17-7566-4e18-bddb-09bd7bd3a3ed.jpg?w=960&amp;fit=max" />  </p>
<p>Part of the moral and ethical imperative of abolition is keeping front of mind those who are, or have been, incarcerated. While our mutual aid projects and practices engage in dismantling the carceral system, we should make sure we’re also supporting people who are currently detained within it.</p>
<p>Over the coming months, we’ll share mutual aid projects in Southern California that do just that, starting with <a href="https://www.powerblossoms.org/?utm_source=MutualAidLA&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=14-may" target="_blank">Power Blossoms</a>.</p>
<p>Established in spring of 2020, Power Blossoms aims to support incarcerated or detained queer and trans individuals in California. Co-founder Melian says it’s important to maintain contact with folks who’ve been removed from their communities.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="newsletter-image" src="https://buttondown.imgix.net/images/207a8905-2829-4fb4-b8c2-a4b96e731c93.jpg?w=960&amp;fit=max" />  </p>
<p>Power Blossoms’ projects include birthday cards, letter writing, a pen-pal program and care packages. While the birthday cards establish communication between an incarcerated person and an individual (or group) on the outside, the letter writing, pen-pals and care packages deepen the connection. Incarceration is already an isolating experience, and Melian points out that queer and trans people are much less likely to have family support during their incarceration, therefore the group aims to meaningfully connect with as many people as possible.</p>
<p>In addition to letting the incarcerated person know there are people on the outside who care about them, the communications also provide an opportunity for that person to engage with their trans identity. Whereas the jail or prison is not a safe place for a trans person, the letters are. The letters use the correct names and pronouns and treat the recipient with the dignity and respect that they are entitled to.</p>
<p>Power Blossoms’ projects have led to a range of beautiful outcomes, from a recipient of commissary money using the funds to buy care packages for other trans women who have no support, to pen-pals on the outside helping newly released people connect with support upon reentry. Power Blossoms recently received a note of gratitude from an incarcerated person whose successful parole hearing was bolstered in part by a letter of support to the board from the organization.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="newsletter-image" src="https://buttondown.imgix.net/images/975fefc2-1a94-443d-916e-81bd6d9a97d6.jpg?w=960&amp;fit=max" />  </p>
<p>Melian acknowledges that for some, this kind of outreach work (done largely alone, at home) may be viewed as not glamorous, and that hurdle can make it hard to keep volunteers engaged.</p>
<p>But, we’re betting that among our Dispatch readers, there are some introverts, people with challenging schedules, and/or other folks who stay close to home for whatever reason, who may be interested in lending a hand(written letter 😎) to Power Blossoms.</p>
<p>Melian and her co-founder Cynthia are currently re-tooling some of their existing projects in the hopes of increasing the number of people Power Blossoms reaches and establishing deeper, more long-term connections. Which means, they’ll need a lot of new pen-pals, and other support!</p>

You can also pitch in on other jobs like shopping, assembling kits, or making sandwiches. We’ve done 140+ straight weekly distros with the intention of being pillars of non-transactional community infrastructure. Please get in touch with us <a href="https://www.instagram.com/solidarityandsnacks?utm_source=MutualAidLA&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=14-may" target="_blank">on IG</a>! TIME or MONEY are most helpful right now. All $$$ goes directly to supplies redistributed as equitably as possible.<br />
<strong>WHEN:</strong> Distros are Tuesdays 7-9 AM and Saturdays 11am-1pm<br />
<strong>WHERE:</strong> Skid row, Chinatown, El Pueblo<br />
