<h2>MUTUAL AID LA: <strong>GOINGS-ON</strong></h2>

<p>Hi! We’re thrilled you’re here for this month’s collection of LA-based mutual aid and grass roots efforts and the array of ways they’ve got for you to contribute. We’re also excited for you to get to know March’s featured effort: Palms Unhoused Mutual Aid (PUMA).</p>

<p>Please open your hearts, calendars and pockets and give generously. <a href="https://buttondown.email/MutualAidLA">Share</a> this dispatch far and wide, as many groups are running out of funds and experiencing a low volunteer turnout. We know it’s easy to feel overwhelmed and hopeless when looking around the world and seeing the bleak reality, but we’ve got to remember and remind each other that there are things we can do that have an impact right here in our own neighborhoods. It is often there that people find meaning and light and reason to move forward.</p>

<p>If you are part of a mutual aid or grass roots effort or event and you’d like to be included in our April dispatch, please fill out the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeNax1_Dxh-sWs6a7-bbKi80X6oxF69Lgbvt72yhchIZrh01w/viewform">provided form</a>. Even if the effort has been included in a previous dispatch, we ask that you re-submit new and/or recurring opportunities every month so we can keep this thing a current and useful resource.</p>

<h2>FEATURED EFFORT: <strong>PALMS UNHOUSED MUTUAL AID</strong></h2>

<div class="effort">
<div class="column1">
<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/palmsunhousedmutualaid/">Palms Unhoused Mutual Aid (PUMA)</a> is a localized care network which aims to meet community needs among unhoused and housing insecure neighbors across Mid-City and Palms. PUMA tackles this goal through a variety of efforts and coalitions, including weekly outreach with food, water, hygiene, and survival items to encampments and unhoused neighbors, collaboration with <a href="https://www.laneighbors4neighbors.org/">LA Neighbors 4 Neighbors’</a> monthly Resource Center, weekly harm reduction at local encampments, collaboration with <a href="https://linktr.ee/PalmsActionCollective">Palms Action Collective</a> to attain grants for and distribute hygiene kits with direct cash assistance, local advocacy on issues of houselessness, and much more.</p>

<p>PUMA’s mutual aid efforts are collaborative between housed and unhoused neighbors. In early February, PUMA launched a headlamp drive for our unhoused neighbors at the suggestion of members of the community in order to offer a reliable source of light through the night. Regarding advocacy, over the past months local city offices and service providers have come to learn about what PUMA does and have invited PUMA members to participate in meetings dealing with issues of houselessness, which offers the opportunity for PUMA to give perspectives as a group that is consistently doing on-the-ground work in collaboration with unhoused neighbors.</p>
</div>
<div class="column2">
<p>PUMA strongly urges city officials to further engage with and call unhoused neighbors to be part of these problem-solving meetings.</p>
