<h2>MUTUAL AID LA: <strong>GOINGS-ON</strong></h2>

<p>Greetings! Welcome to our fifth dispatch, another installment of LA-based mutual aid and grassroots efforts for you to explore, support, and join. As we witness the city’s horrifying displacement of our unhoused neighbors through the so-called “CARE+” sweeps, the overmilitarization of LAPD and LASD, and the at-times overwhelming heat of summer upon us, we are also witnessing many people working so hard to fight back and care for our communities.</p>

<p>After a period of rebuilding Mutual Aid LA with long-term sustainability as a top priority, we’re ready to welcome people (back) into the fold for both in-person and remote forms of engagement. Here, we’ve got several opportunities ready and waiting. There’s always room for more at <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mutualaidla/">Produce in the Park</a> , our free food distribution program in collaboration with the LA Community Fridges (Thursdays 11:30AM-1:15PM @ St. James Park near USC). <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Sul9BF4vcOaEmyMUHLL_eROpbtChCA-ERR2Vt6qqOHA/edit">Sign up</a> and be sure to check out our new <a href="https://www.bonfire.com/store/produce-in-the-park/">merch for purch</a>!</p>

<p>Do you see yourself as the tapped-in type? Or do you aspire to be a tad more tuned-in to all the resources and efforts in L.A.? Great! <strong>Consider joining the Dispatch team!</strong> Yes, this here thing you’re reading right now. We could really, really use your help. Or, devote some time and skills to helping us build a countywide <strong>resource and group directory</strong> for everyone to utilize. Please <a href="https://airtable.com/shrEB2zzpEGEBsFPb">reach out</a>  if you want to learn more about any of these opportunities!</p>

<p>We hope this dispatch provides you with the info and inspiration you need to get or stay involved in a way that works for you. It’s easy to get bogged down and feel hopeless in response to what’s going on in the world, but we promise you that you will not regret throwing yourself into an effort for the people. We are stronger when we move in solidarity and more hands make less work. That’s how we sustain this.</p>

<p>If you would like a group or event you’re a part of to be listed in the next dispatch, we’d love to hear all about it via this <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeNax1_Dxh-sWs6a7-bbKi80X6oxF69Lgbvt72yhchIZrh01w/viewform">form</a>. Don’t forget to resubmit to be included again. There’s no limit.</p>

<p>In solidarity!</p>

<h2>FEATURED EFFORT: <strong>SOLIDARITY AND SNACKS</strong></h2>

<div class="effort">
<div class="column1">
<p>Solidarity and Snacks (SASS) (https://linktr.ee/solidaritysnax) started with a small group of people handing out food, water and sunscreen to the many protesters who took to the streets of Los Angeles for racial justice during the summer of 2020. For a considerably long stretch of time, there were actions happening daily and you could count on spotting SASS pushing and pulling their camera-carts-turned-supply-wagons through crowds and up and down hills. Why camera carts? More than half of the people that make up SASS are members of IATSE, the entertainment industry’s labor union. Witnessing folks from this group take the skills, stamina, discipline and ability to work as a team–things you gain from long hours and unreliable conditions of a film set–and apply them to a movement, is a true and steady source of hope and motivation.</p>
<p>The fact that SASS, almost 2 years later, is still out there every week with a camera cart of concessions to sustain protestors at BLM’s End Police Associations Rally, is a good reminder that everybody can use what they have to fight our current disaster of a system and work to build something totally new rooted in care.</p>
<div><a href="https://www.patreon.com/solidarityandsnacks" title="Patreon"><img alt="" src="https://buttondown-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/images/2b3a3ba5-dce0-4829-bac9-df679dba07e4.jpg"/></a></div>
<p>Only a few months after forming, SASS expanded their efforts to get food, water and supplies out to the unhoused communities they began to know, mostly in Skid Row. This became a weekly, reliable distribution at 6th and San Pedro and at El Pueblo near Union Station. While city leaders ordered countless sweeps where city sanitation workers and cops would violently destroy homes, possessions and supplies of unhoused communities, SASS would be there to listen and support those who had experienced the sweep.</p>
<div><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Cakegs-pnSE/" title="Instagram fundraising post"><img alt="" src="https://buttondown-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/images/7417ab7e-9bc0-400b-8018-3353402d8423.jpg"/></a></div>
<p>And what support looks like is always shifting. This is because survival as a houseless individual is always shifting due to being completely vulnerable to everything and anything from severe temperatures to polluted air to unprovoked violence by cops to deterioration of mental health from trauma to hostile architecture and a removal of public facilities and resources. Since their start, SASS has raised funds for a number of things like hot coffee and meals, PPE, hygiene items, warm clothing, solar phone chargers, blankets, tents, reusable toilets, tarps and water.</p>
</div>
<div class="column2">
<p>This group has figured out how to make a donated dollar stretch with wholesale and bulk orders and item donations from friends and networks. They’ve distributed tax credit and return kits and offered Know Your Rights information around ordinance 41.18. SASS refuses to be stagnant. Instead, they’ve become an ever-evolving true mutual-aid practicing community. Now, the Skid Row distribution is organized and run by housed and houseless participants alike. Which was their goal all along.</p>

<p>Just a couple minutes browsing the posts on the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Cakegs-pnSE/">@solidarityandsnacks IG</a>  provides a record of this city’s relentless attacks on houseless folks and the formation and resilience of a community in response. We have the opportunity to be a part of sustaining this radical care.</p>
