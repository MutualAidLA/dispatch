<h2><strong>OUR STRUGGLE WITH HISTORY</strong></h2>
<p>Recently, MALAN’s political education group discussed the need to recognize that people have struggled for liberation long before us. The weight of liberatory action can feel overwhelming when we map it against the lengthy history of oppression. But capitalism is maintained by alienating us from our long record of resistance, just as it alienates us from our communities. We examine and acknowledge the history of those who have struggled to dispel the lie that there is no other way but capitalism.</p>
<p>From generational wealth built on stolen land by stolen people to rainbow capitalism and redlining, racial capitalism mythologizes progress to hide exploitation and white supremacy. For that reason alone we must work with an honest and thorough recollection of the past. From fugitivity to picket lines, people have shown overwhelming resistance to capitalism’s so-called prosperity. The marooned, the radical, the organizer, and the revolutionary are the blueprints of our success. Instead of defeat we face landlords, politicians, and police who violently insist capitalism is the only way.</p>
<p>The state has only offered violence, both banal and horrific, in response to acts of mutual aid. They use segregation by borders or prison cells or inside “safe” hotel rooms to conceal systemic failures, the same way they conceal brutal exploitation with incomplete histories. The state discredits and punishes anyone who resists the demands of racial capitalism. Understanding the history of resistance is proof that no state will unite us in community.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a violent capitalist state does not change the fact of our resistance. Mutual aid is how we survive, by connecting with one another and building community over time. Understanding the long struggle for liberation connects old fights with new. We refuse to leave people behind. Instead, we bridge past struggles with an ongoing communal effort that transcends the borders of time and bonds us with everyone who challenged capitalism before us.</p>

<h2>FEATURED EFFORT: <strong>Polo’s Pantry</strong></h2>
<p>Food energizes us, brings us pleasure, connects us to culture and builds or strengthens community. But access to fresh and nutritious foods is <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CaKbK6xrR7S/?img_index=6&amp;utm_source=MutualAidLA&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=17-august" target="_blank">not equitable</a>. This present reality - coupled with a dream of people enjoying true food sovereignty -  is what motivates Los Angeles-based Polo’s Pantry to organize their way to food justice in Southern California.</p>
<p>Angeleno <a href="https://www.castaneafellowship.org/castanea-fellows/melissa-acedera/?utm_source=MutualAidLA&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=17-august" target="_blank">Melissa Acedera</a>, the daughter of Filipino immigrants, has worked over 13 years in the food and beverage industry. Almost twenty years ago, her father passed away due to Type 2 Diabetes complications. This year, Melissa also lost her brother to heart failure. These losses, along with her firsthand experience of food insecurity, inspired Melissa to begin working toward solutions that would connect food insecure communities with healthy ingredients and empower them to decide what food justice looks like for themselves.</p>
<p>Named in memory of her father, Melissa founded Polo’s Pantry when she began picking up excess produce from local markets and distributing it from her car in 2018—first in Skid Row, then expanding into parts of Koreatown and Echo Park. In these neighborhoods, Melissa saw the effects of <a href="https://regeneration.org/nexus/food-apartheid?utm_source=MutualAidLA&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=17-august" target="_blank">food apartheid</a> firsthand and knew it was important to expand this work.</p>
<p>Today, Polo’s Pantry includes the paid efforts of Melissa and Director of Operations Nina Angelo. Supported by volunteers and organizers, they generate, guide and support food distributions in Los Angeles and Orange Counties through coalition building and connecting with organizers. They use recovered produce from local markets and farms, partnering with organizations like <a href="https://foodforward.org/?utm_source=MutualAidLA&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=17-august" target="_blank">Food Forward</a> and <a href="https://www.gods-pantry.org/?utm_source=MutualAidLA&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=17-august" target="_blank">God’s Pantry</a> and picking up excess meals from Everytable. Polo’s purchases food from local BIPOC farmers, providing financial support to marginalized vendors by purchasing foods that can be sent straight into neighborhoods that need them via distributions.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/polospantryla/?utm_source=MutualAidLA&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=17-august" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="newsletter-image" src="https://buttondown.imgix.net/images/3666236b-5b22-4d82-b367-807885e08656.jpg?w=960&amp;fit=max" /></a></p>
<p>Each distribution is unique. Teens from <a href="https://www.lasfotosproject.org/?utm_source=MutualAidLA&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=17-august" target="_blank">Las Fotos Project</a> run the distro in Boyle Heights. In South LA and Compton, Polo’s Pantry works alongside Miss Rodgers’ Neighborhood to provide resources for grocery distribution. And in the Coachella Valley and Santa Maria, Polo’s Pantry collaborates with Alianza Nacional de Campesinas, an advocacy organization, to offer monthly produce distributions to farm worker families. Here, volunteers - many of them experienced in farm work themselves - transform truckloads of produce into colorful boxes of fruits and vegetables for pick up. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/polospantryla/?utm_source=MutualAidLA&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=17-august" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="newsletter-image" src="https://buttondown.imgix.net/images/bf3a0f24-d061-4a85-b079-ac3aadcd4758.jpg?w=960&amp;fit=max" /></a></p>
<p>Another effort under Polo’s umbrella is Home-y Made Meals, a project that began in March 2020 with the goal of harnessing Angelenos' desire to share meals with their unhoused neighbors while accounting for the safety needs and capacities of all involved. The result has been a joyous web of volunteers - some who prepare meals in their homes and some who transport them - culminating in a pass-the-baton style operation that distributes hundreds of meals.</p>
<p>Polo’s believes true food justice can only occur when foods are available to everyone equitably at the systemic level. That is why they work to empower neighborhoods to build their own food systems tailored to their needs. They do this by hosting youth-focused educational events where experts like urban farmers and food scientists share their knowledge. Additionally, Polo’s makes their office at <a href="https://www.therobinson.space/?utm_source=MutualAidLA&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=17-august" target="_blank">The Robinson SPACE</a> in East Hollywood available as a meeting space for organizing efforts, engages in advocacy work, and lends their expertise when food policy decisions are being made.</p>
<p>What would true food sovereignty look like? The answer is as complex as each community and as limitless as its members’ imaginations. Melissa imagines something along these lines: Neighbors learn the principles of growing their own foods in the soils and climate where they live and then put those principles into action. If or when that food is sold, it’s sold through a worker cooperative and the money goes back into the community. Land is used for community spaces like gardens and meeting centers. And folks eat foods that are relevant and meaningful to their cultures.</p>
<p>Polo’s Pantry distributed food to over 228,000 people in 2022 and continues to empower folks across Los Angeles and Orange Counties to reimagine their own food systems. A widely impactful grassroots effort like Polo’s Pantry needs people-power to keep the resources flowing.</p>
