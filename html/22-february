## A FEW WORDS ON: **PUBLIC SPACE**

I’ve been thinking a lot, lately, about what public space means.
 
Public space as both a material place, and a unit to measure physical, emotional and ideological distance.
 
The vast sprawl of our mummified metropolis can make it difficult at times to diagnose what specific ailments are causing its organ failure and creaking bones. More importantly — and most frustratingly — it can feel extremely overwhelming trying to decide the most immediate and impactful approach to resuscitate and rehabilitate it.
 
The obvious and “easy” solution, of course, would be a rapid redistribution of wealth from an extractive ownership class combined with an immediate reversal of the decades of disinvestment by a local political establishment beholden to police leagues and real estate firms who have aided and abetted the deterioration of our schools, our transit, our housing stock, our green spaces, union jobs, our dignity.
 
I remain hopeful that we’ll eventually enact those changes through meaningful resistance and collective action. I am also not so naïve to believe that such a radical realignment of political economy will happen quickly enough to revive the body of the city and its citizenry. Five of our neighbors without shelter will have died in the street by the time I finish writing this draft tonight. They don’t have the luxury of waiting. The bottom-up coalition-building required to topple such top-down inequality and austerity first needs a literal common ground on which to meet. 
 
This is why public spaces, as sites of possibility, are so critical. As refutations of the profit-centers and speculative rent-seeking that define the character of the rest of the city, our parks, playgrounds, streets and neighborhood gardens serve as sites of community and commonality. Because they thrust typically isolated and segregated strangers into occupying the same space, public spaces shrink the towering scope of the city. They bring us together, make our common concerns more manageable  and help simplify and expedite the repairs necessary for the communities that give the city its heartbeat.
 
And it’s within these public spaces where the most immediate material benefit can reach our neighbors—collaborative acts that help suture the wounds of precarity in real time while alleviating the aches and pains of our ever-widening alienation: Mutual Aid. Whether at Produce in the Park or weekly outreach for our housing- and food-insecure neighbors in Lincoln Heights, mutual aid finds people coming together, as one, to provide direct action and sustained networks of care for folks who can’t afford to wait on the results of the next election cycle. Mutual aid is a bridge in a city that loves fences. Mutual aid defies the logic of enclosure, gentrification, militarization, privatization and privation — all accumulative forces that profit from keeping us fragmented and unconcerned with mutual obligation. We can, and should, depend on each other.
 
And fuck fences! From Echo Park Lake to the People’s Park in Berkeley to the torn-down fence in Gaza — our world and shared humanity becomes much smaller and more legible when we share the same space and the same resources. Let’s act like our neighbors are just within arm’s reach, because they are.

## FEATURED EFFORT: **THE PUBLIC SCHOOL**

Founded in 2007 under Telic Arts Exchange, [The Public School](https://www.instagram.com/thepublicschoolla/) is a groundbreaking initiative that emerged from a desire to redefine education and challenge traditional structures. We operate as a decentralized, non-hierarchical educational platform with no fixed curriculum. In 2007, conversations about alternative pedagogical models, the exploitative nature of traditional educational institutions, and ways to create new forms of knowledge evolved into a space where classes are proposed and organized by the public.

 FOR IMAGE PLACEMENT. TRANSLATION + BUTTONDOWN CAN DISREGARD:

At its core, [The Public School](https://linktr.ee/tpsla) is guided by several underlying values that set it apart. From the project’s inception, we have prioritized the democratization of knowledge, believing that education should not be confined within the walls of academic institutions. We continue to strive to make learning accessible to everyone. The Public School's decentralized model allows anyone to propose a class that anyone can attend, fostering a sense of inclusivity and shared ownership of the learning experience. We reject accreditation, degrees, and affiliations with public school systems, and operate on the assumption that knowledge is interconnected and can be found in everything. The project thrives on self-education, autonomy, and resistance to institutionalized structures.

We offer all of our **classes** (such as the upcoming Psychoanalysis in the Soviet Union), **workshops** (on topics like wilderness skills, somatic practices, and post-capitalist infrastructures), **reading groups** (on materialist feminism, the first volume of “Capital,” and Los Angeles’ Political economy, to name a few), and **film screenings** (see our upcoming Collective Cinema series) for free or at a minimal cost, reflecting a commitment to the intrinsic value of knowledge over financial considerations—education should be a public service rather than a commodity. 

 FOR IMAGE PLACEMENT. TRANSLATION + BUTTONDOWN CAN DISREGARD:

After over a decade of continuous operation, The Public School, like many other radical endeavors, suffered immensely in 2020 and was unable to continue on in its established location. Since then, classes have taken place at various venues around the city as the team works tirelessly to regain the momentum we had prior to the pandemic. We recently launched a new class roster for the first half of the year, and are expanding the project to provide other needed services to the city, including a community mental health project called Mutual Aid Self/Social Therapy, open to anyone who wants to learn skills to help overcome emotional difficulties and deal with trauma and burnout in their community outside of the therapy office.

 FOR IMAGE PLACEMENT. TRANSLATION + BUTTONDOWN CAN DISREGARD: image pair here (class roster post + new MAST post + old MAST post)  

The Public School is both an educational experiment and a revolutionary concept that seeks to transform the landscape of learning. The always-evolving project features multiple subject tracks for upcoming curriculums, including politics & theory, mental health, media & aesthetics, and practical skills workshops, and we’re aiming to offer more all the time. The [proposal form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeYF96GvAwKGvvbTk4l6N1-IV40cGUvP2MtuANc97oOxojl1w/viewform?usp=sf_link) for classes stays open all year and we’re actively scheduling new classes every month, so keep checking our pages for updates!
