<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>SEPTEMBER 2022</strong></p>

<h2>MUTUAL AID LA: <strong>GOINGS-ON</strong></h2>
<p>Hi! It’s been a moment but the dispatch is back with its sixth installment and we’re grateful you’re here right now, reading it. Before anything else, we’d like to uplift the <a href="https://servicesnotsweeps.com/?utm_source=MutualAidLA&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=the-mutual-aid-la-dispatch-6-september" target="_blank">Services Not Sweeps</a> coalition and community that have been fighting the expansion of the immensely harmful, violent, and deadly 41.18 ordinance, which makes it illegal to sit, lie, sleep or store property in public and is intended to harm our unhoused neighbors. We have witnessed up close how this ordinance truly destroys lives without offering any meaningful path to shelter, much less housing. When people are swept and displaced–oftentimes moving just a few blocks away–they can lose connections to services, life-saving items like medicines and identification and a familiar community needed for survival. This destabilizing paired with the severe lack of available services makes 41.18’s existence, and especially its expansion, even more illogical, violent, and cruel to our unhoused neighbors. </p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the abuse continues at city hall as our City Council chooses to limit public comment, leaving very little to no time for the very people who are affected by this ordinance to address the council. We support our community of housed and unhoused organizers who shut down the council meetings in an attempt to give the public a chance to speak – a people’s public comment. We wholeheartedly reject the comparison of this demonstration of first amendment rights to the January 6th insurrection. The <a href="https://twitter.com/wehosjc/status/1557069370693525504?utm_source=MutualAidLA&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=the-mutual-aid-la-dispatch-6-september" target="_blank">violence</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/UnrigLA/status/1557430537328832513?utm_source=MutualAidLA&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=the-mutual-aid-la-dispatch-6-september" target="_blank">racism</a> shown by the council members themselves and <a href="https://twitter.com/JonnyPeltz/status/1557061494189150208?utm_source=MutualAidLA&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=the-mutual-aid-la-dispatch-6-september" target="_blank">through LAPD</a> is beyond unacceptable, and we all need to be opposing their actions, racism, and violent legislation.</p>
<p>It’s hard to find words right now given the state of everything, especially with the heat as an added layer of heaviness, concern and emergency. But again, we’re glad you’re here and especially appreciate your patience between dispatches. We’ve outgrown Mailchimp’s free newsletter account and took some time to migrate everything over to <a href="https://buttondown.email/?utm_source=MutualAidLA&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=the-mutual-aid-la-dispatch-6-september" target="_blank">Buttondown</a>, a more <a href="https://buttondown.email/features/run-by-a-human?utm_source=MutualAidLA&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=the-mutual-aid-la-dispatch-6-september" target="_blank">transparent</a> and simple, human-feeling platform run by a friendly and generous (in our experience) person named <a href="https://www.arcana.computer/?utm_source=MutualAidLA&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=the-mutual-aid-la-dispatch-6-september" target="_blank">Justin Duke</a>. </p>
<p>No matter the platform, we will always work to be a free, straightforward, reliable and increasingly accessible resource for those who are just starting out or continuing to plug in to these supportive communities, and in doing so, find and create hope. Let’s bring more people in and be working together toward a better quality of life for everybody in this city. We also hope you are finding space to care for yourself and your immediate community. Remember that joy is radical!</p>
<h2>FEATURED EFFORT: <strong>WATER DROP LA</strong></h2>
<div class="effort">
<div class="column1">
<p>As temperatures rise in Los Angeles, <a href="https://www.waterdropla.org/">Water Drop LA (WDLA)</a> continues the work they began with their formation in September 2020: getting drinkable water to people and communities with little to no access. At that point in time, the recent college grads had no grand plan to build anything like the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CRo8CgWAcF_/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link
">Water Drop LA team</a> we see out there today. This was just a group of friends, responding to an immediate need. But the concept of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CSx0jBmFLxJ/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link">mutual aid</a> had reached social media and was getting an unprecedented amount of attention from the general public and attention translated into money. People were more than willing to donate in the face of the pandemic and the city's relentless efforts to keep resources from those that actually needed them. Water Drop directed most of their resources toward Skid Row, where there are only <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Cd9s1WYLhXf/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link">8 working water fountains</a> for the estimated 4,662 houseless individuals and heat related emergency room visits are double LA County’s average.</p>
<div><a href="https://www.waterdropla.org/" title="Water Drop LA Volunteers grab water from the truck"><img src="https://buttondown-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/images/66d4cbe5-fc11-4d76-84b6-b5111958ddd6.jpg" alt="volunteers grab water from truck"></a></div>
<p>We’ve watched the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CctQdOVvR6K/">Water Drop's</a> operation evolve as funds and people power allowed for it. From U-haul rentals to more pallets ordered each week to setting up a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CcT8VFiJSlw/"> donation drop-off</a> for folks to bring supplies and clothing specifically requested by Skid Row residents, you could feel a steady pace. Consistency is valuable because it means you can be relied upon. To rely on something means there’s trust being built and eventually relationships. These are things emphasized by WDLA's organizers.</p>
<div><a href="https://www.waterdropla.org/links" title="waterdropla.org/links"><img src="https://buttondown-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/images/4d052d88-391b-443b-8548-10dde6c39fff.jpg" alt="Water Drop LA group"></a></div>
<p>In addition to their in-person consistency, WDLA is impressively consistent online. They use instagram not just to update us on initiatives but to educate us by letting us in on what they learn. One instagram post reads, “While rich Angelenos fund philanthropic water insecurity initiatives abroad, many don’t realize that #waterinsecurity exists right in their backyard. In Skid Row, for example, thousands live without regular access to clean drinking water. The same goes for low-income communities in LA who are subject to poorly maintained housing with landlords who don’t replace the pipes.” Nothing is posted on the WDLA account without ways we can act in response to the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CfQJ0PfrBSJ/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link">dark realities they often present.</a> And these actions are <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Ch_K7Nrv9gR/">all very doable,</a> like checking in on your neighbors or passing out frozen water.</p>
<div><a href="https://www.waterdropla.org" title="waterdropla.org"><img src="https://buttondown-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/images/44d3337e-87b0-4318-b033-b85f7fedb73e.jpg" alt="unloading truck lift gate"></a></div>
<p>Consistent donations enabled WDLA to expand their reach and capacity beyond the 6-7 pallets of water (or 3,000 dollars worth) they’d been distributing in Skid Row each weekend. They could now invite other groups to sign-up and receive a substantial amount of water on a monthly basis. By procuring and transporting the water, WDLA helped <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CXurq7CLBdk/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link
">fuel and sustain the work</a> of so many groups, like that of Solidarity and Snacks or of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CXp4nnIrc_e/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link
">Polo’s Pantry</a> which took them out to distribute water to the farmworkers of Coachella Valley–who feed Los Angeles every day.</p>
<p>As Water Drop LA celebrates their <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/ChX-pU9Pdi3/?igshid=MDJmNzVkMjY%3D">2 Year Water Drop-Aversary</a>, 105+ consecutive Sunday drops and about 200,000 gallons of water distributed, it's noticeable that the flood of attention from 2020--and the money that accompanied it--has slowed all the way down to a trickle, while of course the need for water has not. But WDLA organizers have the marathon mindset when it comes to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tv/CfCym56Ajzq/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link
">this fight</a>. While Water Drop has had to do some scaling back, they’ve also remained steadfast and in sync with a foundational commitment to one another as humans and our collective access to clean, drinkable water. A slide in an instagram post reads, “Let's be clear. We need permanent water infrastructure solutions because homelessness will never go away overnight, but while focusing on access to permanent housing, we need to also ensure that the basic human needs of those waiting for housing are met.”</p>

The <a href="https://www.instagram.com/lacommunityfridges/?utm_source=MutualAidLA&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=the-mutual-aid-la-dispatch-6-september" target="_blank">LACF Moving Team</a> makes maneuvering hunks of metal look easy. The team needs your help to coordinate and schedule, source fridges or become a Helping Hand (folks willing to help lift a fridge in the truck). The BIGGEST need is 1-2 TRUCK DRIVING volunteers willing to do about 1 move/month. This role has played an integral part in helping the <a href="https://linktr.ee/lacommunityfridge?utm_source=MutualAidLA&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=the-mutual-aid-la-dispatch-6-september" target="_blank">Los Angeles Community Fridge</a> network stay healthy and growing. WANT TO JOIN THE TEAM? Download the signal messaging app and head to the <a href="http://bit.ly/fridgemovers?utm_source=MutualAidLA&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=the-mutual-aid-la-dispatch-6-september" target="_blank">link in our bio</a> to introduce yourself within the fridge movers team!  <br />
<strong>WHEN:</strong> TBD but pretty flexible.<br />
<strong>WHERE:</strong> All over L.A. (Moves are within a reasonable distance from YOU!) <br />
<strong>$$$:</strong> High gas prices means we’re raising funds to reimburse our fridge movers who’ve been racking up miles with fridge pick-ups and deliveries! Venmo: @Sarah-Ginsburg w/ an ice cube emoji.</p>
