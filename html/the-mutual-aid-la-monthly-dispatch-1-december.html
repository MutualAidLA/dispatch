<h2>MUTUAL AID LA: <strong>GOINGS-ON</strong></h2>

<p>Thank you for opening the first Mutual Aid LA Monthly Dispatch! Mutual Aid LA is now focusing on being a connector and informational hub for localized mutual aid efforts across Los Angeles. We become a strong and sustainable people-powered movement when we lean on one another, collaborate, delegate, communicate and share resources and ideas. This movement remains people-powered if we keep bringing people in, so we created this dispatch as an invitation, a catalyst for jumping on in. Below you’ll find a collection of opportunities to contribute to Los Angeles-based efforts in the form of time, money and/or items. If you’d like more folks to know about the ways they can contribute to a mutual aid effort that you are a part of, fill out <a href="https://forms.gle/VUNXrejGbtk3W4ba8">this</a> form and we’ll get you in the next dispatch!</p>
