<h2>MUTUAL AID LA: <strong>GOINGS-ON</strong></h2>

<p>Hello and Happy New Year! Thank you for taking a look at our second monthly dispatch. Below you’ll find a collection of opportunities to contribute to Los Angeles-based efforts in the form of time, money and/or items. If there’s a mutual aid effort you are a part of or think highly of and would like other folks to know how they can keep it cooking, be sure somebody from the group fills out <a href="https://forms.gle/VUNXrejGbtk3W4ba8">this</a> form in order to submit to be a part of next month’s dispatch!</p>

<h2>FEATURED EFFORT: <strong>PRODUCE IN THE PARK</strong></h2>

<div class="effort">
<div class="column1">
<p>Every Thursday folks gather at the sweetest little parcel of land in the middle of the city near USC for <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CXhbKidv0wz/">Produce in the Park</a>. It was started over a year ago by Mutual Aid LA organizers who coordinated pick-up of rescued surplus produce in Commerce, transport to <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/LQrKuZHFy3pUMG758">Saint James Park</a> to be culled and sorted and then delivery to several LA Community Fridges.</p>
<p>Neighbors of the park began expressing an interest in what was going on, and organizers adapted by adding a free produce bag component. Produce in the Park is now a steady operation distributing to more than 50 people right in the park and stocking at least 5 fridges every week. This is a true mutual aid effort as everyone is welcomed to show up, pitch in if they’d like and take as much as they can carry.</p>

There is currently an encampment of unhoused veterans on the West La Va campus, a 388 piece of land deeded to veterans as a “disabled soldiers home” in 1887. However, illegal land leases run rampant on the property utilizing buildings and more space that is needed for permanent supportive housing. Please join us in continuing to advocate for our community.<br/>

LAN4N is a volunteer-led organization fighting for housing justice and services for unhoused Angelenos. Since unhoused folks live disconnected from services and the city of LA constantly displaces our neighbors through violent sweeps, we bring folks back together through a once-a-month resource center that provides a variety of survival resources and services. Direct transportation is provided for all guests. We are looking for volunteers to join our outreach team and provide support for our monthly resource center. Email us at <a href="mailto:laneighbors4neighbors@gmail.com">laneighbors4neighbors@gmail.com</a> to get involved.<br/>
<strong>WHEN:</strong> The Resource Center occurs the third Saturday of every month from 8am - 4pm. Outreach efforts happen daily. *Due to the surge in covid cases, for our next center (Jan. 15) we have pivoted to an outreach/distribution effort for that date. Email us if you are interested. The next Access Center will be Feb. 19 pending covid protocols and precautions.<br/>
