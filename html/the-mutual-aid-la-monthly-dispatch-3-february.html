<h2>MUTUAL AID LA: <strong>GOINGS-ON</strong></h2>

<p>Greetings from your friends at <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mutualaidla/">Mutual Aid LA</a>! We’re excited you decided to spend a few minutes with our third dispatch–which if you’re unfamiliar–is a roundup of groups across Los Angeles engaging in mutual aid work. <a href="https://www.mutualaidla.org/">Mutual Aid LA</a> was formed in response to COVID-19, but it’s clear there will be negligence by our city’s government with or without a pandemic. We’ve been reevaluating and shifting and building a new foundation so that our group functions as a network that connects people with groups and groups with one another. Accessible directories of mutual aid groups and resources are in progress, along with more in-person and remote opportunities to learn from and support one another. <a href="https://buttondown.email/MutualAidLA/archive/">Share</a> this dispatch, <a href="https://forms.gle/VUNXrejGbtk3W4ba8">submit</a> efforts you think should be a part of this dispatch and above all, use this dispatch to
meaningfully engage with the city you call home.</p>

<h2>FEATURED EFFORT: <strong>SOUTH HILL FRIDGE</strong></h2>

<div class="effort">
<div class="column1">
<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/southhillfridge/">The South Hill Fridge</a> popped up just across the 110 from USC at South Hill &amp; W 28th in August of 2020 as a part of the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/lacommunityfridges/">LA Community Fridges network</a>. It’s often challenging to find a fridge host who can provide a reliable electricity hook up, an accessible location with foot traffic and width for the fridge to not be an obstacle, who is welcoming to all community members and who doesn’t collaborate with law enforcement, but the folks who run <a href="https://www.cargocostume.com/">Cargo Costume</a>, approached LACF ready to host and provide everything asked for and more.</p>
<div><a href="https://www.instagram.com/southhillfridge/" title="Instagram"><img alt="" src="https://buttondown-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/images/c3c1c284-c470-4670-8e6d-e5c5bc184a3f.jpg"/></a></div>
<p>The fridge serves a housed community in nearby apartments and the unhoused community in the surrounding blocks. A few months after first plugging it in, fridge organizers started to hear feedback from the unhoused community about how it was tricky for them to risk leaving their possessions to make the mile round-trip walk to a fridge that is often empty. And so, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CVlKiyXPDRG/">South Hill Sundays</a> was launched and with the help of ready-to-eat meal suppliers like <a href="https://www.josfcenter.org/">Joy of Sharing</a> and <a href="https://thegoodkarmala.org/">The Good Karma</a>, meals are picked up and distributed both by wagon to encampments and by hand at the fridge itself.</p>
<p>As organizers continue to build relationships with the surrounding community, they’ve expanded what they provide and are calling in more volunteers to keep it happening consistently.</p>
</div>
<div class="column2">
<p>This mutual aid effort raises money to purchase as well as collects donations of hygiene items, water, pet food, clothing, tarps, socks, blankets, and gift cards to distribute along with the meals. And they’re always scheming up more for the near future, like a resource list specifically tailored for unhoused individuals, a pet wellness clinic for the neighborhood’s many <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CZZtO8nJqVH/">dogs and cats</a> and a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CZH1I03JatS/">Drug Store day inspired by the organizers at MacArthur Park</a>. Keep an eye on The South Hill Fridge, as it’s a beautiful example of a hyper local mutual aid project that has had challenges but even more growth, and therefore continues to be a hub of resources for the community in which it lives.</p>

is organizing the 2022 Homeless Youth Count with USC. Strong community coordination is essential for organizing a Youth Count that accurately estimates young people experiencing homelessness in LA. This year is more important than ever as it will be the first Youth Count since the COVID-19 pandemic began. We are inviting the expertise and knowledge of student groups, local organizations, mutual aid groups, and faith-based communities to join this effort. We are organizing 3 high impact <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CZumhcav_Xu/">Blitz days</a> which are weekends dedicated to focusing a concerted effort on a single community to canvas as many census tracts as possible. On a community blitz day, volunteer teams will arrive at a deployment site, receive a short training, and be assigned a group of census tracts to canvas. Teams canvas using a census tract map either in their car or walking, identifying, approaching, and engaging with any young people who may be experiencing homelessness to complete a 2 minute compensated survey. Community Blitz Days will provide food, beverages, and mutual aid supplies for groups who volunteer.
