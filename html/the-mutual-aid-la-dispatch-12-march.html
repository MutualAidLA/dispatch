<h2>A FEW WORDS ON: <strong>SPRING</strong></h2>
<p>As spring begins it brings with it a sense of growth, renewal, and hope. It&rsquo;s a time when communities come together as people emerge from their homes to more wholly engage the world. To celebrate this spirit of new beginnings, I&rsquo;d like to challenge you to invite people from your circles to engage in mutual aid and bear witness to how interconnected our communities are.</p>
<p>Whether it&rsquo;s participating in a cold weather drive, cooking nutritious meals for unhoused neighbors, or sharing skills with other community members, by working together to plant these seeds of mutual aid, we can watch as the knowledge, resources, and support flourish. It&rsquo;s been a long winter. There is a tremendous amount of stress that accompanies the holidays, cold/flu/COVID season, and cold weather—uniquely so for those who engage in mutual aid work where our interdependence is more palpable. New collaborators bring fresh perspectives and passion—both crucial to reigniting enthusiasm for the work and strengthening each group&rsquo;s reach in the community.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s welcome the new beginnings that spring brings and build a world where everyone has what they need to thrive.</p>

<p>With music in the air, next to a line of smiling people filling bags with colorful organic produce and passing them along, Verneen Mincey of DCR, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/blmlosangeles/?utm_source=MutualAidLA&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=the-mutual-aid-la-dispatch-12-march" target="_blank">BLM LA</a>, and <a href="https://fannielouhamerinstitute.org?utm_source=MutualAidLA&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=the-mutual-aid-la-dispatch-12-march" target="_blank">FLHI</a> observed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We do this to be in community with the vendors here in Africa Town but also to offer healthy options. With a focus on plant-based food, we bring attention to food justice and the benefits of eating well.</p>

Walk-ups are welcome.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="newsletter-image" src="https://buttondown-attachments.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/bc8a7c82-55a3-4eb2-9dad-be2a841e5e3e.jpg" /> </p>
<p>In addition to distributing more than 100 bags of groceries at the February 19 event, DCR worked with <a href="https://www.instagram.com/evrythngcreativ/?utm_source=MutualAidLA&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=the-mutual-aid-la-dispatch-12-march" target="_blank">Evrythng Creativ</a> to serve just as many hot meals. This installment of the Soul Food event series, dubbed <strong><em>From Farm to Table</em></strong>, featured Chef Kahil Sadiq demonstrating how to cook the produce without letting anything go to waste.</p>
<p>Mrs. Linda Morgan Sam and Evrythng Creativ’s Jonathan Gooden hatched the idea for Sadiq’s Kah’s Grill to be there serving <a href="https://worldcrunch.com/culture-society/the-ital-diet-a-rastafarian-recipe-for-eating-right?utm_source=MutualAidLA&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=the-mutual-aid-la-dispatch-12-march" target="_blank">Ital vegetables</a> over brown rice with cornbread and fresh fruit, with DCR and Liberty covering the cost of the hot meals.</p>
<p>Morgan Sam expanded on the intent of the program this way:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We were trying to coordinate so that people can express and understand farm to table. So with the fresh fruit and vegetables that are offered in the bags, the chef can then represent that to the table, and we have the experience, so that people know what they can cook from the bag.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Gooden brought expertise honed while producing the Soul Food events that began in 2021 at <a href="https://www.theumojacenter.com?utm_source=MutualAidLA&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=the-mutual-aid-la-dispatch-12-march" target="_blank">The Umoja Center</a>. He also helped Reimagine LA Foundation’s <a href="https://www.reimaginelafoundation.org/post/south-central-la-memorial-day-culture-fest?utm_source=MutualAidLA&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=the-mutual-aid-la-dispatch-12-march" target="_blank">South Central LA Cultural Fest</a> feed over 1,000 people and provide access to child care products and transportation resources.

<p>The steady flow of community members coming to pick up groceries and breaking bread with each other, talking and laughing over meals, is nourishment itself. Basking in the glow of gratitude and solidarity, new volunteer Leo wondered, “How could I not have a good time here?”</p>

We are abolitionists fighting for food sovereignty in LA by recovering food that’s destined for landfills and giving it to those who need it instead. We are looking for a volunteer with a car who can pick up excess, recovered food for us on Tuesdays at 10am in Mar Vista, and deliver it to our storage space in Culver City.<br />
<strong>WHEN</strong>: Tuesdays at 10am<br />
<strong>WHERE:</strong> West LA (Mar Vista &gt; Culver City)<br />
