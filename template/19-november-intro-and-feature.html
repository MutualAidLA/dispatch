## A FEW WORDS ON: **Feelings of Duality in Mutual Aid**

“What would our world look like if we all had equal access to food?”

I always find myself asking this question as I engage in food-related mutual aid work. There are so many amazing care networks that our local community has created to help ensure each other’s survival as we all continue to see the violent impacts of capitalism and how food insecurity, as a byproduct of capitalism, has decimated communities.  But for all the joy and hope I feel every time I see a community fridge and see people volunteering to provide food for each other, I can’t help but be reminded of why we must engage in this work. It is because our basic needs are not only not being met, but the resources needed to meet them are being gatekept from us for profit.  There are financial barriers to simply having access to water; big box stores are putting every essential item behind lock and key; healthy organic foods are more expensive; the list goes on and on.

On one hand, it can feel disheartening and hopeless to live this reality and to see that the only ways we’re able to truly meet our community’s needs are to ditch the systems we’ve been told to rely on and instead find care amongst each other.  But the more I witness the beauty of community care, the more I believe that this is truly the only way we will collectively survive whatever is to come.  It is liberating to build something outside of the government, the city, and the nonprofit industrial complex in which collective wellbeing is the first priority. We are building a world/city/network where we are thinking about what we can give to each other, rather than what we can take or what will be taken from us. Seeing this in action somehow turns my hopelessness into hope.

## FEATURED EFFORT: **Home-y Made Meals**

In the summer of 2020, my partner Sarah came across an IG post calling for 1) cooks, people who might be interested in making meals from the comfort of their homes and 2) drivers, the out-and-about, errand-types who would pick up meals from said homes and shuttle them to people who need them. These asks were clear, feasible and felt considerate of people’s various COVID safety needs. A handful of people from the group were pictured together in the first slide of the post, big smiles obvious behind their masks, emanating a palpable joy we hadn’t seen in awhile. Shortly after signing up, we found ourselves loading 20 meals into the car of a new Home-y, and stepping into a life-changing community.Three and half years in, Home-y Made Meals has served over 125,000 free meals to people in Los Angeles and Orange County. It’s a 100% people-powered, pass-the-baton-style initiative in which volunteers from all around Southern California prepare, deliver, and serve homemade meals every day. These meals go to coalitions and mutual aid groups, several of which have been featured right here in The Dispatch, responding to an ever-growing unhoused population and food insecurity crisis that has only been exacerbated by the pandemic and neglected by city officials.

What makes Home-y Made Meals unique are the people who started it. The project is a collaboration between [Eayikes](https://eayikes.org/), an organization which centers around community, empowerment and connecting with one another, and [Polo’s Pantry](https://www.polospantry.org/), which focuses on food justice and food sovereignty. The product is a combination of each group’s core purpose: to feed people and to cultivate joy and connection in this often devastating work. After meeting any of the Home-y organizers or attending any event they host, you quickly understand how much love and fun truly guides this operation. Furthermore, they see this work as highly political, and they’ve never strayed away from naming the systemic conditions that have led to food insecurity.

When I talk to people about Home-y, I always reiterate how easy it is to take part. If you go the chef route, you’ll receive an email two weeks ahead of time asking if you can make x-amount of meals (anywhere from 10-30) to be picked up on a specific date and time. You have plenty of time to meal plan, buy supplies and prepare the bags. You get a text from a real person confirming pick-up time and without fail, that real person appears at your home, loads the meals in their car and your leg of the race is complete. 

If you’re concerned about the cost of supplies, you can schedule a time to shop at Home-y’s free pantry beforehand, making the operation more accessible and sustainable for everyone. Your meals can be as complex (see [My Nanay’s Kitchen](https://www.instagram.com/my.nanays.kitchen/?hl=en)) or as simple (I stick to PB&J’s) as you want. Between shopping and cooking, my process is usually less than two hours. If you are a driver, a Home-y coordinator sends you all the details you need to successfully complete 2-4 pickups from chefs (living within reasonable distance from you and one another) and the final drop-off of the meals. They do all the coordinating for you, and that’s a dream as a volunteer.

For me, Home-y was a gateway to understanding and getting involved in the practice of mutual aid as a whole. The ease of their process was one thing, but then I met Alex Yoon, one of the originators, in person. After an engaging and honest conversation (most are with Alex), he invited me to a distribution they helped make happen at [LACAN](https://cangress.org/) in Skid Row. This led to meeting Melissa Acedera of Polo’s Pantry (be sure to read the September Dispatch Feature), and the rest of the core Home-y team: Jenny, Sonia, Angela, Jackie, and Lance. Their energy kept me coming back and wanting to do more and more. The world was on fire in so many ways, and it still is. But these people were and are fighting for a world they want to see with actual, radical joy. That’s the only way mutual aid work can be sustainable.
