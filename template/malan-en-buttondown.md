## A FEW WORDS ON: **THE RADICAL ACT OF TAKING A BREAK**

Our capitalist hellscape teaches us that our physical and emotional needs are secondary to propping up the system. ‚ÄúTaking a break‚Äù is a radical act‚Äîas is reframing how we think about it.

Instead of, ‚ÄúRecharge now, then do more later,‚Äù [The Nap Ministry wisely encourages us](https://www.instagram.com/p/CtRHExEuu1O/) to rest simply because it‚Äôs our right.

Taking time to tend to ourselves will help us get clarity in our roles and find a more tenable way to share resources‚Äîwhich ultimately benefits us all.

## FEATURED EFFORT: **FARM2POWER**

[![](https://buttondown.imgix.net/images/da31a457-f89a-4082-a9f3-78c033faea74.jpg?w=960&fit=max)](https://www.farm2power.org/)

During the pandemic, as many Angelenos struggled to meet basic needs and local farmers struggled as sales dwindled, Amari Gaiter and Elliott Snow saw the opportunity to create an equitable food system that would connect farmers directly to people in need of food. They recruited colleagues Zoya Abbas and Sarah Bacio, and [Farm2Power](https://www.farm2power.org/) - a Los Angeles-based mutual aid collective aiming to uplift BIPOC farmers and provide fresh food to those facing food insecurity - was born.
