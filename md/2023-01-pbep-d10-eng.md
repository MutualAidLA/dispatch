## MUTUAL AID LA: **GOINGS-ON**

A lot of us enter a new year with big ambitions, worthy intentions, and seemingly endless goals. But oftentimes, our resolutions morph into memories within a month or two. 

Perhaps the reason we struggle with resolutions is that resolutions = tasks and none of us want more tasks! Practices, however, are rooted in values; cultivate both inward and outward change; and include sustainability, steadiness, and nuance.

If you haven’t considered it already, how about prioritizing practices over resolutions in 2023? Creating change is itself a practice, and our approach to dismantling oppressive systems and engaging in mutual aid requires the same humility, determination and time that one might invest in learning a new skill. 

Reconfiguring our mindsets from the task-oriented “I need to volunteer more” to the values-focused “I’m part of an interconnected community and I’m committed to its well-being,” is liberating! It allows us to let go of perfectionism, and loosen our grips on individualism.

Beyond being rooted in values, practices and mutual aid share a lot of qualities—they can be small or large, are cultivated and grown over time, and allow space for trial and error and grace, as we figure out what works.

And, as is true of developing personal practices, there’s no correct way to “do” mutual aid. Everyone can provide, or need, aid at any time. We eventually find a pace that works for us, maybe even hitting a stride, but practicing patience when—yes, when—that stride is disrupted is key. Whether you’re able to share your time and skills or leverage your resources once a month, once a week, or daily, you’re making a positive impact and doing so with intention. And because you have participated in your community, you have more folks to turn to when—yes, when— you need help.

There are people, groups, and projects that welcome our contributions year-round. Your participation will be as valued on July 12th as it is January 1st. 

So, here’s to ditching rigid goals and tasks as a means for improvement and instead normalizing values-centered circuitous paths—ones that focus on interdependence and shared humanity alongside personal wellbeing.

## FEATURED EFFORT: **PASADENA BLACK EQUITY&nbsp;PROJECT**

<a href="https://www.instagram.com/pasadenablackequityproject/"><img src="https://buttondown-attachments.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/baeea6e7-fa62-4504-8ed2-75fa99d7d5c8.png" alt="" /></a>

In the spring of 2020, Barnard College student Elise Logan and UCLA Student Mia Glionna were completing their junior-year coursework online in their hometown of Pasadena. At this time, data had begun to show that the COVID-19 pandemic disproportionately affected Black communities—[something that is still a reality,](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/investigations-discovery/hospitalization-death-by-race-ethnicity.html) nearly three years into the pandemic. Elise and Mia knew that the pandemic was another grave challenge on top of other systemic injustices that their Black neighbors faced, such as [housing inequality](https://www.pusd.us/site/handlers/filedownload.ashx?moduleinstanceid=12689&dataid=22509&FileName=2019-20%20PUSD%20Target%20Group%20Overlap_SpEd%20Corrected.pdf) , [displacement](https://www.latimes.com/socal/glendale-news-press/tn-pas-0807-census-story.html) , [income and resource disparities](https://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/alfresco/publication-pdfs/413102-Impact-of-the-Great-Recession-and-Beyond.PDF) , and [police violence](https://mappingpoliceviolence.org/?year=2022&location=California&race=Black+people). They knew that it was time to take action. They also knew that they could not wait for local, county, and state governments to meet these needs. They needed to get resources right into the hands of their neighbors as soon as possible.

So, with the hope of establishing a living and lasting network of care for Black Pasadenans, Mia and Elise created the [Pasadena Black Equity Project](https://www.instagram.com/pasadenablackequityproject/). One critical initiative on the agenda? Raise funds to help ease the educational, healthcare, living and community costs of their Black neighbors in need. PBEP established a mutual aid fund, set a goal, sought donations, leveraged social media and began to do just that. This past July, they hosted an event called Summer of Sol to benefit their mutual aid fund. Attendees could enjoy performances by Black artists, indulge in food from Black vendors, and participate in interactive educational activities that explore Black history in Pasadena and how it connects to the present day. They plan to host a third annual benefit concert again this summer. PBEP takes a joyful approach to building their mutual aid fund - one that brings folks together.

But fundraising is only one realm of PBEP’s work. While the immediate fruit of their labor is easing the material burdens of their Pasadena neighbors, PBEP’s organizers share an even deeper goal: to preserve the legacy of the Black community in Pasadena through memory and archiving work. In 2022, they began preparing for a digital archive project, collecting photos and oral histories that help tell the story of Black Pasadenans. PBEP plans to make another call for materials in 2023! Their efforts affirm that keeping local memory alive is work in which an entire community can participate. The group invites folks to engage in collective and collaborative storytelling. 
“This community-run initiative is important because many historical institutions with authority (e.g., schools,
libraries, museums, archives, textbook manufacturers etc.) have controlled how we are
represented and remembered”, Elise and Mia shared in a recent conversation, “and we wish to reclaim the agency of self-representation.”

![](https://buttondown-attachments.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/42ba2ebc-4408-45cf-989d-928111d25bf6.png)

In addition to honoring the past, PBEP also celebrates the present voices of Pasadena’s Black community. They plan to begin publishing a biannual zine in 2023! Their zine will feature the work of Black artists, writers, and activists. They hope the zine will educate readers about local community organizing and the power of mutual aid. Proceeds from zine sales will be sown back into the local community via the mutual aid fund. 

The Pasadena Black Equity Project is a youth-led movement, currently run by a group of Pasadena-based organizers dedicated to both preserving the past and nourishing future generations. To date, they have released 52 stipends to bring financial relief to Black Pasadenans, and there are still people on the waiting list to receive support. With your help, PBEP’s work can go even further. If you live in or around Pasadena, this is an especially impactful way to care for the neighbors nearest you and redistribute funds to those most impacted by systemic injustice.
