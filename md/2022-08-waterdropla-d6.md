## MUTUAL AID LA: **GOINGS-ON**

Greetings! Welcome to our sixth dispatch, another installment of LA-based mutual aid and grassroots efforts for you to explore, support, and join. We are happy to announce we outgrew Mailchimp‚Äôs free account and have switched to [Buttondown](https://buttondown.email/) to send this newsletter. Buttondown is run independently by [Justin Duke](https://www.arcana.computer/), who has been kind and helpful as we migrated over, is very [transparent](https://buttondown.email/features/run-by-a-human) and donates to the open source software that powers Buttondown. We appreciate your patience as we have taken longer to release this dispatch while we worked on the transition.

We want to take this opportunity to uplift the [Services Not Sweeps](https://servicesnotsweeps.com/) coalition and community that has been working to oppose expansion of the immensely harmful, violent, and deadly 41.18 ordinance ‚Äì the no sitting, sleeping, lying, or storing property in public ‚Äì intended to harm our unhoused neighbors. We have witnessed firsthand how this ordinance destroys communities without offering any meaningful path even to shelter, much less to housing, to our unhoused neighbors. These displacements cause people to lose connections to services, lose life-saving items like medicines and identification, and be displaced often only a street or block away. The destabilizing of our unhoused community paired with the severe lack of available services makes the ordinance's existence and especially its expansion, even more illogical, violent, and cruel. City Council limits public comment so much that most of the very people who are affected by this ordinance, our unhoused neighbors, never get to address the council. We support our community who shut down the council meetings in an attempt to give the public a chance to speak ‚Äì the People‚Äôs Public Comment. We wholeheartedly reject the comparison of this demonstration of first amendment rights to the J6 insurrection. We want to uplift [LA CAN‚Äôs statement](https://twitter.com/LACANetwork/status/1556780108299399174) on this, as well as [this interview](https://www.democracynow.org/2022/8/11/la_homelessness_byproduct_failed_housing_system) with LA CAN's executive director Pete White. The [violence](https://twitter.com/wehosjc/status/1557069370693525504) and [racism](https://twitter.com/UnrigLA/status/1557430537328832513) shown by the council members themselves and [through LAPD](https://twitter.com/JonnyPeltz/status/1557061494189150208) is unacceptable, and we should all be opposing their actions, racism, and violent legislation.

It‚Äôs hard to find words right now given the state of everything, but we‚Äôre glad you‚Äôre here and reading this, and we hope you can find some places to plug in to the community below, and in doing so, find and create hope. We also hope you are finding space to care for yourself and your community. Remember that joy is radical!

We are pumped to feature WaterDrop LA in this installment of the Dispatch!

## FEATURED EFFORT: **WaterDrop LA**

<div class="effort">

<div><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Cg2zClwPjnC/" title="SAVE THE DATE for Water Drop LA‚Äôs 2 year drop-aversary / birthday party @therobinsonspace on September 9th"><img src="https://buttondown.s3.amazonaws.com/images/e3926d60-adc8-459d-9713-b3badb0f5b41.jpg" alt="2 year drop-aversary flyer"></a></div>
<p>On July 24, WaterDrop, a group of organizers dedicated to ensuring clean water access for all our unhoused and low-income community members, turned 2‚Äîand their work is far from over. With 100+ drops and just about 200,000 gallons of water distributed. What started as a small act of community care in 2020 has grown into a powerful movement of solidarity with the local fight for clean water access. There are over 4500 unhoused people living in Skid Row alone, WaterDrop‚Äôs main area of focus, and this is a low estimate. ‚Äú<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Cd9s1WYLhXf/">There are 8 water fountains for over 2,570 unsheltered residents of Skid Row.</a>‚Äù Many water fountains are broken. Most temporary shelter occupants are not allowed to stay in the building during the day, so they have to wait outside until nightfall. This increases the need for public access to water. ‚ÄúWe need permanent water infrastructure solutions because homelessness will never go away overnight, but while focusing on access to permanent housing, we need to also ensure that the basic human needs of those waiting for housing are met.‚Äù They‚Äôre advocating for the installation of water infrastructure, but because it is guaranteed to take a lot of time, they distribute water in Skid Row & DTLA every weekend. At a minimum. Not counting distribution to other groups.</p>

<p>Temperatures are rising, not out of the ordinary to hit 90 degrees or higher these days. Skid Row has one of the highest rates of heat related emergency room use - more than double the average rate for LA County. Heat related emergency room visits in Skid Row are double the average for LA County. With such high temperatures, access to water, electrolytes, and shade are vitally important.</p>

<div class="column2">
<p>While rich Angelenos fund philanthropic water insecurity initiatives abroad, many don‚Äôt realize that <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/waterinsecurity/">#WaterInsecurity</a> exists right in their backyard. In Skid Row, for example, thousands live without regular access to clean drinking water. The same goes for low-income communities in LA who are subject to poorly maintained housing with landlords who don‚Äôt replace the pipes. Not only does WaterDropLA consistently do these drops and share with other orgs, they educate us via in-person teach-ins and on their IG. While <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/mutualaid/">#MutualAid</a> groups popped up around the city en mass in 2020 (ourselves included), mutual aid has been a foundational part of survival in marginalized communities for generations. This is just a starting list of some of the important things that differentiate mutual aid from charity & underscore the importance of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/solidaritynotcharity/">#SolidarityNotCharity</a>!</p>
