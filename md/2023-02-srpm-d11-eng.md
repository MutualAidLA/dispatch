## MUTUAL AID LA: **DIRECT AID**

This year in The Dispatch, we’re eager to share some ideas around wealth redistribution and the practice of direct aid. But for now, we’re gifting you a cute Valentine’s Day idea: fall in love with direct aid, and break up with strings-attached giving. We’re encouraging people with funds left over after basic living expenses are met—especially white folks—to give money directly to people who need it instead of defaulting to big organizations with shiny ‘donate’ pages. Let's trust that people know what they need, when they need it, instead of trying to control other people's lives by attaching expectations to the funds we redistribute.

Speaking to my fellow white people for a moment: let’s not forget that, like this land, what we have been taught to view as “our” money is not ours. It isn't earned. It's acquired through the system of racial capitalism that allows those at the top of the racial hierarchy to exploit those at the bottom for financial and social gain. This is yet another reason it’s time to let go of the idea that we have any right to control the wealth we redistribute—it isn’t really ours to begin with!

There’s no time like the month of love to get extra passionate about bursting the systems that create concentrated wealth. Own your big, thumping heart and redistribute radically to strengthen a system of community care where everybody has what they need to survive and thrive.

We’ll be back with more on this throughout the year, but we’ll leave you with some direct aid accounts to follow, as well as an incredibly helpful [budgeting guide](https://www.instagram.com/p/COxdNDepjQp/) made by Pocket Change Pools on IG [@pocketchangepools](https://www.instagram.com/pocketchangepools/?hl=en). These tools can help all of us take up our responsibility to consistently and intentionally redistribute our wealth.

The following accounts make posts and stories for you to act on by giving funds and circulating to your networks so that folks’ needs can be met: [@heyrox___](https://www.instagram.com/heyrox___/), [@bunnyishthing](https://www.instagram.com/bunnyishthing/), [@thesapphicsiren](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cf4khBytE40/), [@queer_funds](https://www.instagram.com/queer_funds/), [@BlackGirlMighty](https://www.instagram.com/blackgirlmighty/), [@redistributeurwealth](https://www.instagram.com/redistributeurwealth/), [@pocketchangepools](https://www.instagram.com/pocketchangepools/), and [@aidformamas2](https://www.instagram.com/aid4mamas2/)

Also IRL when folks ask for it! Carry cash and give when asked.

## FEATURED EFFORT: **SKID ROW PEOPLE’S&nbsp;MARKET**

<a href="https://www.instagram.com/skidrowpeoplesmarket/"><img src="https://buttondown-attachments.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/449feb29-07d7-4fcb-9273-462962cf1ee5.jpg" alt="" /></a>

“I don’t know what we’d do without Skid Row’s People Market,” says Stephanie Williams looking at the bodega across from her white portable shelter on the corner of 5th and San Pedro in downtown Los Angeles. “We’re like a family.”

Stephanie has known about the Skid Row People’s Market since she began organizing in Skid Row ten years ago, back when it was named the Best Market.

“It means a lot that the People’s Market is right across the street,” says Stephanie. “I can charge my phone, use their fridge to store food, use their water to clean the sidewalk.”

May Park and her husband Bob bought the Best Market in 1995. When their son Danny took over in 2018, he changed the name to Skid Row People’s Market — part of a deeper, intentional transformation to embrace the ways this bodega is rooted in community, healing and mutual aid.

“We’re figuring out what is best for the community, bringing in healthy foods, and making sure that everyone feels welcome whether they have money or not,” says P.K., a People’s Market staff member and Skid Row resident.

Danny and the staff are keenly aware of the troubled legacy of Korean store owners in majority-Black neighborhoods that have been under-resourced and neglected by lawmakers. One of the ways they are actively working to rectify the historic divisions is by embracing the principles of mutual aid instead of extractive capitalism. They keep prices low, run tabs for people to help them build credit (the vast majority of participants pay back the micro-loans).

The People’s Market partners with community-supported agriculture programs like [With Love Community](https://www.withlovela.com/) to access fresh fruits and vegetables for the store. They host Skid Row community members who cook and give away healthy meals. And they employ Black staff members, some of whom live in Skid Row.

“It’s a challenge to be sustainable, it requires a lot of hours from very few people to keep the store running,” says P.K. But the years of building connections with Skid Row residents pay off in other ways. “Yesterday someone collapsed on the floor crying, and while I was helping them, another community member jumped in to fill in my role behind the counter. That just wouldn’t happen in a big chain store owned by Amazon; they’d resort to police strategies and drag them out.”

“We’re a safe space rooted in community. It's like the saying up here,” P.K. says, pointing to the words painted across the bodega's wall: _A safe space for the Skid Row community to heal our spirits and develop healthy identities._
