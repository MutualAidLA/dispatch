## MUTUAL AID LA: **GOINGS-ON**

‚ÄòTis the season many people find themselves in a giving mood. It‚Äôs also a time when people make room for new things by saying farewell to the old(er). If you‚Äôre someone that values extending the life of your used items and you‚Äôve found a mutual aid group to donate to, read over our DOs & DO NOT DOs guide to help ensure your donation has a positive impact. These tips are coming straight from the experiences of groups and organizers across Los Angeles, from the San Fernando Valley to MacArthur Park and beyond. Let‚Äôs thank these contributors in the best possible way and follow their directions.

### ‚úÖ the **DOs**

- **DO pay close attention to what is being requested** and try not to stray. If you‚Äôre stumped, reach out (via email, DM) to the group collecting and ask for clarification - sending a picture of what you have can be very helpful. **DO take into consideration seasonally appropriate clothing.**
- **DO wash, clean, sort, fold, neatly bag, and label** everything you‚Äôre donating. **DO ask before leaving items** at an organizer‚Äôs space, like their front door.
- **DO be clear and honest** in your communication with organizers.
- **DO be flexible, mindful, patient and even accommodating** when figuring out donation pick-ups and drop-offs. DO give more than a tiny pick-up window and DO offer to drop off the donation if you can.
- **DO offer to store larger items** for the group until needed if you‚Äôre able.
- **DO check in with the group** before purchasing new items so you can find out what items they prefer store-bought or what items they‚Äôre low on.
- **DO really get into it** and hold mini drives for a group requesting items. **DO tap your various circles** and get them into it too.
- **DO make it known to neighbors, co-workers, friends and fam** that you, for example, are collecting to-go utensils and bags for community fridges and food distribution projects like [Produce in the Park](https://campsite.bio/mutualaidla) and [Free Food Collective](https://www.instagram.com/freefoodcollective/) who are always in need of bags. And wrapped utensils are always needed at the community fridges.
- **DO utilize the tools at your fingertips**‚ÄìBuy Nothing, Marketplace, OfferUp, Freebie Stuff Alerts app‚Äìand search for or post that you‚Äôre collecting a list of specific items.

#### **FOOD-SPECIFIC DOs**

- **DO read the specifications carefully when you donate food** - generally donating expired items is a no-no, but some pantries have a little bit of leeway. Always check first!
- If giving a lot of perishable food to an unhoused neighbor, **DO consider or ask whether they have space to store** any leftovers or if they are able to consume the food before it spoils.
- **At the [community fridges](https://community-fridge.bubbleapps.io/):**
    - **DO package individual portions** of food from large catering trays for safer accessibility.
    - **DO bring utensils,** especially if they‚Äôd be helpful to consume the food you‚Äôve brought.
    - **DO tidy up** and leave things nicer than you found them. If you find food clearly past its prime in the fridge, **toss it before restocking.** To help keep the trash down at the fridge site, **bring items with you to throw away** in your bin at home.
    - **DO learn where the next closest community fridge is** in case the first fridge you stop at is full.

### ‚ùå the **DO NOT DOs**

- **DO NOT donate items you wouldn‚Äôt be willing to wear, use or consume yourself.** All of us deserve quality items, including our unhoused neighbors. **No smelly, tattered or stained clothing.** Cut those items up to be used as napkins or cleaning rags and nix paper towel use.
- **DO NOT assume what people need.** With everyone, at all times - ask what is needed.
- **DO NOT donate used socks or underwear.**
- **DO NOT throw in random items** that the group did not ask for. DO NOT underestimate the time and labor required to deal with unneeded stuff.
- **DO NOT have unrealistic expectations of mutual aid groups and individuals.** If you truly need the item out by tomorrow, it‚Äôs probably not going to work out. If you‚Äôre willing to hold onto it for 1-2 weeks, it's more likely someone will find, confirm and coordinate your item‚Äôs new home.
- **DO NOT donate to Goodwill or Salvation Army** if your items aren‚Äôt useful or timely for mutual aid groups. Instead, do a little research and **go with a more ethical alternative.** There are recycling programs out there like [Hylo](https://us.hyloathletics.com/pages/recycling-returns), which is for sneakers.
- **DO NOT just leave items, especially food, at an encampment** or unhoused person‚Äôs dwelling without permission üßÄ üêÄ
- **DO NOT donate food that's been opened or half-eaten.**
- **DO NOT leave boxes or trash** at the community fridges and pantries.

While donating is a super helpful thing to do during the holidays, it‚Äôs important to **offer your support to groups year-round**, and in more ways than one. The Dispatch and Mutual Aid LA Network are here as resources to help you find what fits. Listen, learn, practice, and kindly offer what you now know to the people in your life.

## FEATURED EFFORT: **THE VALLEY OF CHANGE**

<a href="https://www.instagram.com/thevalleyofchange/" title="The Valley of Change Instagram"><img src="https://buttondown.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/4ac2e6e7-3744-487a-83f1-18c1a6656d70.jpg" alt="" /></a>
<br>

I lost count of the number of passers who greeted Latora after 15. Some were curious passers by wanting to know what she was doing and why, others were community members offering support, and a few others took selfies while delivering supplies for the following day‚Äôs meal distribution. You may have seen Latora holding a Black Lives Matter sign and flashing a peace sign at drivers on the corner of Sepulveda and Ventura (outside the Sherman Oaks Galleria) in the San Fernando Valley. She has been there nearly every day since Summer 2020 - to promote police accountability for the murder of George Floyd and others who experience police brutality.

Latora Green is the Co-founder/Executive Director and force behind The Valley of Change (TVOC) - a non-profit whose mission is to liberate Black people from systems of oppression and brutality. TVOC works to uplift marginalized and underserved communities by protesting police brutality and racism, distributing backpacks to children in need, organizing community clean-up days, providing lunches for unhoused neighbors, and cooking and distributing a weekly warm meal.

![](https://buttondown.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/3f677b3b-beaa-4f35-bb67-ff7cfae55c64.jpg)

Latora gives these actions a unique spin by tapping into her background as an HR executive. She reaches out to educate community members (including passers-by) about systems of oppression and brutality while inviting them to participate in and stand up with TVOC. She engages with local schools‚Äì
building relationships with students and their families‚Äìthey assemble hygiene kits, help with the weekly warm meal distribution, and participate in community clean up days.

![](https://buttondown.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/febbcac5-97df-4a11-a2c7-6170bd7d099c.jpg)

TVOC‚Äôs community engagement extends beyond the San Fernando Valley though, they distribute backpacks across Los Angeles neighborhoods, create a monthly Build Up Black calendar of specific actionable ways to support the Black community, and will soon unveil a community educational program empowering children, teens, and adults. TVOC‚Äôs work can be summarized simply as facilitating transformational and meaningful change by empowering, uplifting, giving, and inspiring by consistently showing up for one another and the community.
