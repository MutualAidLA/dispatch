## A FEW WORDS ON: **THE RADICAL ACT OF TAKING A BREAK**

What you’re reading is probably the sixth draft of this intro. Today I worked on it after I finished my 9-to-5. Last weekend, I snuck in some edits between grocery shopping and working on the apartment I just moved into.

Helping to get the Dispatch to you is one of the few ways I can currently support the efforts of Mutual Aid LA Network. My aforementioned 9-to-5 doesn’t afford me the time or the energy to do much else.

Maybe you can relate. And maybe you also relate to the temptation to raise your hand for every mutual aid project that excites you, quickly filling your schedule to the brim … and putting yourself on a direct path to burnout.

Projects fighting injustice are reliably long-term in nature. It may take generations before our efforts are actualized in a transformative way.

So, it’s important to realize that running ourselves ragged is untenable. Ideally, we all have great boundaries and know how to pace ourselves—shifting effortlessly among our mutual aid projects, paid jobs, and any other obligations (or fun stuff!) that life throws our way.

But that’s easier said than done, right?

I offer this: if and when we find ourselves on the precipice of burnout, let’s consider taking a break. We can each choose how a “break” looks for ourselves—it might be taking time off the grid, or rethinking our boundaries, or scaling back/stepping away from certain projects.

Our capitalist hellscape teaches us that our physical and emotional needs are secondary to propping up the system. “Taking a break” is a radical act—as is reframing how we think about it.

Instead of, “Recharge now, then do more later,” [The Nap Ministry wisely encourages us](https://www.instagram.com/p/CtRHExEuu1O/) to rest simply because it’s our right.

Taking time to tend to ourselves will help us get clarity in our roles and find a more tenable way to share resources—which ultimately benefits us all.

## FEATURED EFFORT: **FARM2POWER**

[![](https://buttondown.imgix.net/images/da31a457-f89a-4082-a9f3-78c033faea74.jpg?w=960&fit=max)](https://www.farm2power.org/)

During the pandemic, as many Angelenos struggled to meet basic needs and local farmers struggled as sales dwindled, Amari Gaiter and Elliott Snow saw the opportunity to create an equitable food system that would connect farmers directly to people in need of food. They recruited colleagues Zoya Abbas and Sarah Bacio, and [Farm2Power](https://www.farm2power.org/) - a Los Angeles-based mutual aid collective aiming to uplift BIPOC farmers and provide fresh food to those facing food insecurity - was born.

“We recognized that a lot of neighbors did not have access to fresh food. And many pantries only carried canned or dry goods, so we came up with the idea to host community supported agriculture (CSA) pantries,” says Sarah Bacio. “We partnered with the South Central Farmers Co-op in the summer of 2020 and we were able to raise enough funds to host our first pantry. We've done a pretty good job of holding them each month since then.”

While hospitalizations and deaths related to the pandemic have currently ebbed, food insecurity has remained an issue for many. The first pantry in August 2020 received four sign-ups. As word got out about [Farm2Power](https://linktr.ee/farm2power), sign-ups have more than quadrupled.

Through grassroots fundraising efforts via social media and tabling at events, [Farm2Power raises money](https://www.instagram.com/p/CsZ0rvlAp_G/) to purchase $25 boxes of fresh produce for community members who [fill out a form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfRdjNY9FGW9wgxW4n9DK_L7UGflHa4yHWzB-YDAm1ByWd4aA/viewform) on the Farm2Power website (provided in English, Spanish, Chinese, Tagalog and Korean). [The South Central Farmers Co-op](https://www.scfcoop.southcentralfarmers.com/) - a grassroots collective of BIPOC, majority-women farmers located in Lancaster, CA - assembles the boxes and delivers them to Farm2Power pantries in Koreatown and Compton. From there, people who signed up can pick up their boxes from the pantries or have them delivered wherever they live in L.A. County by Farm2Power volunteers. Each box provides enough produce to last a family for two or more weeks.

Farm2Power organizers also hosted virtual workshops about reinventing food systems through abolition and mutual aid, and reimagining our relationships to food systems through the lens of Indigenous conceptions of reciprocity. In addition, they worked with the [Compton Tenants Union](https://www.instagram.com/comptontenants/) to hold a community cookout where folks shared food, participated in street medic training, and enjoyed a performance by Danza Mexica Cuauhtemoc.

“Raising funds to consistently hold pantries every month is a challenge,” says Kira Morrison. “Early in the pandemic lots of people were donating and volunteering, but resources and funding are harder to come by these days.”

Kira joined Farm2Power recently, after organizing with the [LA Community Fridge Network](https://linktr.ee/lacommunityfridge) and Street Watch for most of the pandemic. A professional musician by trade, Kira is the lead organizer of Root for Farm2Power, a [music and comedy fundraiser to be held on July 21](https://juniorhighlosangeles.com/calendar/root-for-farm2power-2023) at Junior High Los Angeles, featuring Demi Adejuyigbe, Amber & Max (of the band Moonchild), Joel Kim Booster, and more.

“We hope to grow, to be able to do our work in a self-sustaining community garden space and hold in-person workshops on gardening, farming and organizing in the future,” says Sarah.

“It would also be exciting to expand into providing pre-cooked meals for people who don’t have access to a kitchen or the resources to cook fresh produce,” adds Kira. “There are so many people I’m learning from at Farm2Power with visions about how to make food more accessible. We’re excited to make change on a bigger scale.”
