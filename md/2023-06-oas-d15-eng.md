## NEW MALAN PROJECT: **OPEN ART SUPPLY**

[![](https://buttondown.imgix.net/images/39b996f3-1000-4b19-ae53-135a2bd1cb34.jpg?w=960&fit=max)](https://www.mutualaidla.org/open-art-supply-project)

Are you an artist, crafter, and/or parent with an overflowing closet of art supplies? We‚Äôre so excited to tell you about Open Art Supply, a new Mutual Aid LA Network (MALAN) project that distributes free art supplies across LA. We‚Äôre collecting new or gently used arts and crafts supplies and distributing them to Angelenos who may not have access otherwise. If you‚Äôve been meaning to purge your kids‚Äô boxes of colored pencils and crayons, barely used paint sets, or stacks of drawing paper, now‚Äôs the time!

The Sacramento-based org [Broad Room](https://www.instagram.com/broad_room/) hosted an [Art Supply Mutual Aid Training Program](https://broadroom.org/art-supply-mutual-aid-training-program), and mentored 10 groups, including MALAN. We were inspired to see how each group in the cohort addressed and engaged with the concept of free art supplies‚Äîfrom [LA Zine Fest‚Äôs](https://www.instagram.com/lazinefest/) ‚ÄúMake your own Zine‚Äù station, to the [San Jose Makers‚Äô Free Art Supply Closet](https://www.instagram.com/makerscloset/). Since MALAN already functions as a network, we took the opportunity to ask the community on Instagram to recommend their favorite local businesses and creative spaces to host donation boxes. This resulted in over a dozen generous collaborators becoming drop-off hubs for art supply donations.

Click the [map](https://felt.com/map/Open-Art-Supply-W9AjUP0RKTbuW9AXRGQMrOWA) below to find all of the locations with boxes for you to drop off your supplies. And if you‚Äôre in need of art supplies, you‚Äôll find several community spaces we've partnered with that have free stores or shelves inside. (This list of locations is consistently growing!)

While art can provide a therapeutic outlet, and a means of income, it also should be considered a *right* rather than a privilege. With this project, we hope to get the tools for art-making into the hands of everyone who wants them, for whatever reason they want them, no questions asked.

We welcome and would be so grateful for your help and support!
