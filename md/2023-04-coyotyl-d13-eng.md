## **ON GROUNDING IN MUTUAL AID PRACTICE**

We say it often: mutual aid is about support and solidarity, not help and charity. This can be a tough distinction to make in this capitalist system. We’re used to hierarchical structures where deep listening, learning, and grounding—key tools to effective mutual aid—are likely not present, and may even be discouraged.  

It’s these three components that seem to be missing in Inside Safe, Los Angeles’ poorly executed plan to address houselessness. The city’s unwillingness to listen deeply paired with the lack of grounding in a long-term vision (and, of course, intentional cruelty) all contribute to making Inside Safe, thus far, an unnecessarily chaotic disaster.  

Inside Safe is promoted as a “housing-first” program, but what we’ve actually seen is anything but. The city displaces our unhoused neighbors—often far from their connections, communities and jobs—and plops them into hotels without any support. Sometimes they don’t even have adequate food and water!  

One of the many frustrating aspects of organizing around houselessness is that our policy-makers don’t listen to the experts. Those who have become unhoused under this capitalist death machine are the ones who know best what is needed. But no one listens.  

The main goal of Inside Safe appears to be removing unhoused people from public view. So it would seem the program is not grounded in a long term vision of housing for everyone–which explains the program’s inability to adequately meet participants’ needs thus far.  

Where does that leave those of us practicing mutual aid? The good news is that we don’t have to reinvent the wheel every time we build and strengthen support systems. We have each other to learn from—especially elders and those most directly affected—when we ground our mutual aid praxis not only in survival work but also in the long term goal of revolutionary change. If we commit to radical honesty, deep listening, and intentional grounding, we can realize our vision—the dismantling of the oppressive systems under which we live—and build a world in which we are all free.

## FEATURED EFFORT: **COYOTL + MACEHUALLI**

Imagine this: It’s a warm September day in Ascot Hills Park in El Sereno. In a natural dye workshop, participants practice dyeing with cochineal, black walnut and indigo. Elsewhere, visitors play a Tongva dice game with local Tongva, Chumash and Yoeme culture bearers. Still others make art via cyanotype - blue photographic prints that can be achieved without a camera. And everyone celebrates the black walnut tree, a native species that is threatened by development. People adopt trees. People plant trees. People feast, talk, and laugh in community together. It is Takaape’ Waashut Northeast Los Angeles’ Black Walnut Day 2022, and the collective that brought the community together on this day is called Coyotl + Macehualli.  

The name Coyotl + Macehualli is the combination of two words in the Indigenous Nahuatl language. The word *coyotl* means “coyote” and *macehualli* means “Indigenous person”. Combining these two words is a clue to Coyotl + Macehualli’s mission: to help people recognize their connection to animals, plants and the land, and to care for and defend their community’s natural environment. Sometimes, this means propagating, collecting the seeds of, and sharing native plants like the black walnut tree so that folks in neighborhoods like El Sereno (‘Ochuunga, or “Land of the Wild Rose” in Tongva) can enjoy restored natural areas and denser tree canopy. Other times, it means caring for depleted soils and planting more native species. Still other times it means holding local governments accountable and fighting against development and gentrification. It *always* means working horizontally with neighbors to find ways to care for plant and animal relatives.

In this spirit, Coyotl + Macehualli hosts regular events, workshops, and hikes in which participants learn from one another. Coyotl + Macehualli cultivates *collective* knowledge and invites community members to share their experiences and expertise to enrich the lives of all their neighbors. In addition to the Black Walnut Day celebration, Coyotl + Macehualli has hosted night hikes, moonlit gardening, youth art workshops, and consultations from area experts on native-friendly landscaping. These events create space for people to practice being in community. They gain ancestral knowledge that strengthens their bond with the land. And they can share their own wealth of knowledge, too.  

“Since we started, many folks have joined in to learn how to identify local native plant species and understand their importance and role they play,” Brenda, a co-founder of Coyotl + Macehualli, said “Whether it is through a scheduled event, an informal community gardening day or a planning meeting, we are all sharing our collective knowledge and learning from each other and the land as we navigate through our work.”

Accessibility is one of Coyotl + Macehualli’s core values. Members work hard to remove barriers that might prevent people from joining in on the fellowship and learning. While some workshops have a suggested sliding scale donation during fundraising efforts, no one is turned away due to lack of funds, and there is no charge for attending events, adopting plants, or for food. The organization also works to choose meetup locations that meet ADA guidelines and are convenient to public transit stops. And they provide shuttles for hikes to ameliorate mobility-related barriers. In the future, they even hope to provide free childcare.  

Does Coyotl + Macehualli’s work speak to you? Would you like to support them as they strengthen their community by building up stores of collective knowledge, caring for the land, and defending plant and animal relatives? They can use your help. Read on to find out how you can give of your time, funds, and presence to this work.
